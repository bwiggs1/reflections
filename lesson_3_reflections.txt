When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

As a backup measure, or to allow collaborators to work on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In some cases you may only want to work on part of a project rather than the entire project.
