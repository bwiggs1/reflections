What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A hidden folder called ".git" is created within the folder on which the
git init command is run.  This is necessary to initialize the metadata and 
other items that git requires in order to establish a new repository in
which version tracking can proceed.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and
the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area temporarily holds representations of files in the
working directory which are to be committed to the repository when
the next git commit command is run.  The value of this is that one
may decide in advance which files will be worked on and thus flag them 
for future commits by adding them to the staging area.  As work
proceeds, this decision can be revisted and, if necessary, files
can be removed from or added to the staging area before running the
git commit command.
